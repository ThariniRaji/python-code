This repository is designed for beginners who want to practice and strengthen their foundational Python programming skills. It contains simple and clear examples that cover a wide range of basic concepts such as variables, data types, input/output operations, casting, arithmetic and binary operators, and conditional logic using if-else statements.

What's Included:

1. Python Variables: Learn how to declare and use variables of different data types like integers, floats, and strings.


2. Integer and String Data Types: Understand how Python handles different data types, their properties, and how to work with them in your code.


3. Type Casting: Practice converting between data types (e.g., string to integer, integer to float) using int(), float(), and str() functions.


4. Binary Operators: Perform operations using binary arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, //, %, and ** to understand their usage and differences.


5. If-Else Conditions: Implement decision-making in your programs using if, elif, and else statements to control the flow based on conditions.


6. If-Else with Casting: Combine conditionals with type casting to create dynamic and flexible scripts.


7. User Input: Learn how to take input from the user using the input() function. Practice capturing different types of inputs like strings and integers.


8. Arithmetic with Input: Build interactive programs that take two or more inputs from the user and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


9. Practical Examples: Each concept is explained with simple code examples that can be run and modified. These help reinforce learning by encouraging hands-on practice.
